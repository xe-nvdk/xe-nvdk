## About Me

I'm from Canelones, Uruguay, and see myself as a "Plug and Play" person. I love learning new things and dissecting them to understand how they work. For nearly 15 years, I've been writing a blog called [cduser.com](https://cduser.com/), a mix of Spanish and English content, aiming to make high-tech content accessible, especially for those for whom English is a barrier.

My daily tools include [Python](https://python.org), [React](https://react.dev), [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata), [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik), [Portainer](https://github.com/portainer), [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), [Docker](https://docker.com), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) (k3s), [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf), and more. Feel free to ask me about these; while I'm no expert, I'm always happy to share what I know. I've been coding in backend and frontend for over a year, building tools primarily for my use.

I'm an [InfluxAce](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/community-showcase/influxaces/ignacio-van-droogenbroeck/) and won the [Founder's Choice Award in 2020](https://twitter.com/hectorivand/status/1326904489211797506?s=20). I was also a Traefik Ambassador, thanks to my contributions to this fantastic solution and community.

Although my YouTube channels [CDUser](https://www.youtube.com/c/CDUserIgnacioVanDroogenbroeck) are somewhat abandoned, they still offer valuable content watched by hundreds monthly.

### Projects I'm Passionate About:

- **[EZCompose](https://github.com/xe-nvdk/ezcompose)**: A docker-compose file generator.
- **[FlyOrNot](https://github.com/xe-nvdk/flyornot.today)**: A [web page](https://flyornot.today) that advises on weather conditions for flying drones or engaging in aerial sports.
- **[Sourcesift](https://github.com/xe-nvdk/sourcesift)**: Combines a FastAPI backend with a React frontend, helping organize RSS feeds of news and podcasts.
- **[Squeeze](https://github.com/xe-nvdk/squeeze)**: A Python tool that monitors website uptime, integrating with InfluxDB. It's a work in progress, with potential rewriting in the future (3/15/2024).
- **Aerial Tours**: After buying a drone, I began exploring Uruguay from above, sharing videos on this [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTGMySjFM_4PopC6twN67xA).

When I'm not working on data projects or automating with Terraform, I enjoy riding my motorcycle, a [Husqvarna Svartpilen 401](https://i.redd.it/tj5lwilz0g361.jpg).
