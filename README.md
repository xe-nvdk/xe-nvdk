# Hi there 👋
### I'm Nacho, founder of Arc - a high-performance time-series database built for engineers who need data freedom.

## Building Arc
I'm building [Arc](https://github.com/Basekick-Labs/arc) at Basekick Labs - unified infrastructure for metrics, logs, traces, and events. Built on DuckDB, Parquet, and Arrow with **9.47M records/sec ingestion** and the flexibility to run anywhere (local/MinIO/S3/cloud).

**Why Arc exists**: After running a time-series hosting service, I experienced every pain point firsthand - runaway costs forcing customers to delete historical data, vendor lock-in making migrations impossible, proprietary query languages limiting what you can analyze, unstable engines crashing under load. My customers were paying for infrastructure that fought them instead of serving them.

Arc solves this with standard formats (Parquet), SQL queries, and actual data freedom. No proprietary formats. No vendor lock-in. No choosing between cost and retention.

**Current traction**: 390+ GitHub stars in 55 days, 100+ instances running in production, paying customers migrating workloads, investor meetings in progress. Latest version 25.12.1 fully implemented in Go.

**Tech**: Go implementation delivers 130% faster throughput and 97% memory reduction vs initial Python version. One endpoint handles four data types. DuckDB for analytics. Real infrastructure, not another observability layer.

## Background
From Canelones, Uruguay. I've been writing [cduser.com](https://cduser.com/) for 15 years - making high-tech accessible in Spanish and English. [InfluxAce](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/community-showcase/influxaces/ignacio-van-droogenbroeck/) and [2020 Founder's Choice Award](https://twitter.com/hectorivand/status/1326904489211797506?s=20) winner. Former Traefik Ambassador.

**Daily stack**: Python, Go, React, Docker, Kubernetes (k3s), Terraform, Telegraf, Traefik, Portainer. I've been coding backend/frontend for production for over a year, mostly building tools that solve real problems I face.

## Other Projects
- **[EZCompose](https://github.com/xe-nvdk/ezcompose)**: Docker-compose file generator
- **[Aerial Tours](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTGMySjFM_4PopC6twN67xA)**: Uruguay from above via drone

My [CDUser YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CDUserIgnacioVanDroogenbroeck) still gets hundreds of views monthly despite being mostly inactive.

## When I'm Not Building
Running, making BBQ and pizza with friends, flying drones, playing drums. I have two dogs - Olivia (11 years) and Attila (lovable terror).
