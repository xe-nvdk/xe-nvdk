## About me

I'm based in Montevideo, Uruguay and I consider myself an Ops guy. I love to learn new things and break them to see how it works. For almost 12 years I write a blog called [cduser.com](https://cduser.com/) where I dump everything that I learn in Spanish, which is my native language, the objective behind my blog is make high technical content available is Spanish cause, all the cool stuff is written in English and for most people, (including me in the past) the language is a big stop sign.

At this moment, I work for [Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) as Technical Marketing Engineer.

I work almost every day with the following technologies: InfluxDB, Traefik, Portainer, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes (k3s), Telegraf so that you can ask me about any of theses! I'm not saying I'm an expert, and I don't know everything about them, but I will do my best to help you.

I'm learning to code in Python; you can find the things that I made as, result of this process in [this repo](../learning-python).

When I'm not trying to push some data to display in InfluxDB and make a template of it or automate some useless things with Terraform, I enjoy ride in my motorcycle, which is an [Husqvarna Svartpilen 401](https://www.google.com/search?q=svartpilen+401+2020&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwj-p7-nuvrsAhUgArkGHVnKD2wQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=svartpilen+401+2020&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyBggAEAgQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHlD_B1jWC2DmDWgAcAB4AIABVYgB_wKSAQE1mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=FtSrX_7EDKCE5OUP2ZS_4AY&bih=969&biw=1920).

âš¡ Fun fact: I have more than, what, 10 years trying to decide if I keep my beard grow or not, so, in some photos, you will find me with or without, totally random. I love pizza and hang out with friends.
