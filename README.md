## About me

I'm based in Montevideo, Uruguay and I consider myself an Ops guy. I love to learn new things and break them to see how it works. For almost 12 years I write a blog called [cduser.com](https://cduser.com/) where I dump everything that I learn (in Spanish, which is my native language). The objective behind my blog is make high technical content available is Spanish cause, all the cool stuff is written in English and for most people, (including me in the past) the language is a big stop sign.

At this moment, I work for [Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) as Technical Marketing Engineer.

I work almost every day with the following technologies: [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata), [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik), [Portainer](https://github.com/portainer), [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), [Docker](https://docker.com), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) (k3s), [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) so that you can ask me about any of theses! I'm not saying I'm an expert, and I don't know everything about them, but I will do my best to help you.

I have the pleasure of being [InfluxAce](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/community-showcase/influxaces/ignacio-van-droogenbroeck/) and win the [Founder's Choice Award in 2020](https://twitter.com/hectorivand/status/1326904489211797506?s=20). Also, I'm Traefik Ambassador thanks to my contributions spreading the word about this excellent solution.

I'm learning to code in Python; due to this process I'm developing [EZCompose](https://github.com/xe-nvdk/ezcompose) that is a docker-compose.yml file builder. Also, you can find others things that I made in [this repo](https://github.com/xe-nvdk/learning-python). Why? Just for fun.

When I'm not trying to push some data to display in InfluxDB and make a template of it or automating some useless things with Terraform, I enjoy riding in my motorcycle, which is an [Husqvarna Svartpilen 401](https://www.google.com/search?q=svartpilen+401+2020&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwj-p7-nuvrsAhUgArkGHVnKD2wQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=svartpilen+401+2020&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAAyBggAEAgQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHlD_B1jWC2DmDWgAcAB4AIABVYgB_wKSAQE1mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=FtSrX_7EDKCE5OUP2ZS_4AY&bih=969&biw=1920).

âš¡ Fun fact: I have more than, what, 10 years trying to decide if I keep my beard grow or not, so, in some photos, you will find me with or without it, totally random. I love pizza and hang out with friends.
