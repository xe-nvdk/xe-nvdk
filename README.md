## About me

I'm based in Montevideo, Uruguay and I consider myself an Ops guy. I love to learn new things and break them to see how it works. For almost 12 years I write a blog called [cduser.com](https://cduser.com/) where I dump everything that I learn (in Spanish, which is my native language). The objective behind my blog is make high technical content available in Spanish, cause, all the cool stuff is written in English and for most people, (including me in the past) the language is a big stop sign.

In December 2020, I started to work for InfluxData, the creator of [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) as Solutions Architect, now I'm playing as Senior Sales Engineer working with Central of the US and Latam customers. 

I work almost every day with the following technologies: [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata), [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik), [Portainer](https://github.com/portainer), [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), [Docker](https://docker.com), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) (k3s), [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) so that you can ask me about any of these! I'm not saying I'm an expert, and I don't know everything about them, but I will do my best to help you.

I have the pleasure of being [InfluxAce](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/community-showcase/influxaces/ignacio-van-droogenbroeck/) and I won the [Founder's Choice Award in 2020](https://twitter.com/hectorivand/status/1326904489211797506?s=20). Also, I'm Traefik Ambassador thanks to my contributions spreading the word about this excellent solution.

I have the following Youtube channels:

[CDUser](https://www.youtube.com/c/CDUserIgnacioVanDroogenbroeck): Is a channel created in 2009 focused on the IT Pro community.

I'm learning to code in Python; due to this process I'm developing [EZCompose](https://github.com/xe-nvdk/ezcompose) that is a docker-compose.yml file builder, and [Follow The Money](https://github.com/xe-nvdk/follow-the-money) that's a Python App to tracking money using InfluxDB as backend. Also, you can find others things that I made in [this repo](https://github.com/xe-nvdk/learning-python). Why? Just for fun.

When I'm not trying to push some data to display in InfluxDB and make a template of it or automating something with Terraform, I enjoy riding in my motorcycle, which is an [Husqvarna Svartpilen 401](https://i.redd.it/tj5lwilz0g361.jpg).

âš¡ Fun fact: I have more than, what, 10 years trying to decide if I keep my beard grow or not, so, in some photos, you will find me with or without it, totally random. I love pizza and hang out with friends.
